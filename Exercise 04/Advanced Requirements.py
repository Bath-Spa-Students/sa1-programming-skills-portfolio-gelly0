'''
Advanced Requirements:
Ignore Capitalization: Modify your program to accept answers regardless of
the capitalization (e.g., “paris”, “Paris”, and “PaRis” should all be considered
correct). Multiple Questions: Extend the program into a quiz that asks for the
capitals of 10 European countries. Provide feedback for each question.
